Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Martin Golding) If it keeps up,
 man will atrophy all his limbs but the push-button finger. (Frank Lloyd Wright) Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products 
 difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration. (Ray Ozzie) But what is it
 good for? (Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM, commenting on the microchip, 1968) Software suppliers are trying to make their 
 software packages more ‘user-friendly’… Their best approach so far has been to take all the old brochures and stamp the words ‘user-friendly’ on the 
 cover. (Bill Gates)
